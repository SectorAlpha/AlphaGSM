"""Documention for writing gamemodules.


A game server module is a python module in the gamemodules package somewhere
the python import mechanism can find it. It defines various attributes and
functions that provide the functionality for that particular game server.

The attributes and functions that can be specified in a gamemodule are
documented below grouped by the functionality they relate to. All functions and
attributes are required unless explicitly states.


Commands:
    This section documents the attributes related to providing commands for the
    server and modifying exisiting commands.
    Attributes:
        commands: the extra commands available for this type of server as a list.
                DO NOT include commands that the Server class provides but we modify.
        command_args: the arguments for any commands we provide and any extra
                optional arguments that we provide for built in commands in a
                dictionary with the command as the key. See the relevent command's
                section for how the extra arguments are passed though and see the
                documentation of the module core.cmdparse for how the argument specs
                are interpreted.
        command_descriptions: the descriptions for any commands we provide and any
                extra descriptions for built in commands in a dictionary with the 
                command as they key. The extra descriptions are appended to any default
                description.
        command_functions: the functions used to implement any commands we provide
                as a dictionary with the command as the key. Do not provide functions
                for built in commands here as they will be ignored. The functions are
                called by code of the form 
                        module.command_functions[command](*args,**kwargs)
                where args and kwargs are the arguments and options defined in
                command_args.

Setup:
    This section documents the functions used by the setup built in command. Any
    extra arguments and options specified in command_args for "setup" are passed
    to the configure function.
    Functions:
        configure(server,ask,*args,**kwargs): Configure the server. If ask is true
            then prompt the user for input if not enough information is provided. If
            ask is false then throw a ServerError if required information is not
            provided or already in the data store. If the data store already has a
            key it should only be overwritten if instructed  by the user via either
            an argument or on a prompt. This function returns a tuple of args,kwargs
            to pass on to the install function.
     install(server,*args,**kwargs): Install the server. Once this returns the
            server should be ready to be started. This function should do any
            downloading or copying of files necessary for the server to run and setup
            any configururation files necessary for correct running.

Start:
    This section documents the functions used by the start built in command. All
    functions in this section receive the same set of extra arguments as defined
    in command_args. The Server class checks if the server is running before any
    of these functions are called.
    Functions:
        prestart(server,*args,**kwargs) [OPTIONAL]: Do anything that needs doing
            each time before the server start. Could include tidying logs, checking
            config is up to date, checking files are there, ...
        get_start_command(server,*args,**kwargs): Return the script and arguments
            to be called in the new screen session to start the server. The screen
            session will close when this command returns.
        poststart(server,*args,**kwargs) [OPTIONAL]: Do anything that needs doing
            each time after the server command is started. Could include sending
            initialisation commands to the server, checking it's actually running
            correctly, ...

Stop:
    This section documents the function and attribute used by the stop built in
    command. If this module can't stop the server before the timeout (see
    max_stop_wait) then tthe Server class will kill it by killing the screen
    session.
    Attributes:
        max_stop_wait [OPTIONAL]: The maximum number of minutes to wait for the
            server to stop. The timeout is capped at a maximum of 5 minutes
    Functions:
        do_stop(server,time,*args,**kwargs): Try and stop the server. This will
            be called repeatedly till the timeout is reached or the server is
            stopped. time is the number of minutes that have passed since we started
            trying to stop the server.


Status:
    This section documents the function used to display status messages. The
    function is used for a detailed module dependent status if the server is
    running. Verbosness level 0 means only display the one line status message
    so therefore this function is only called for verbose>0. This also means that
    the extra arguments defined in command_args are only used if -v #>0 is given.
    Functions:
        status(server,verbose,*args,**kwargs): Print a status message for the
            server. args and kwargs are the extra arguments defined in
            command_args. This function is free to ignore verbose if it chooses and
            always print the same message (or no message) if various levels of info
            are not available.

Message:
    This section documents the function used to send a message on the server.
    The function is called directly and no processing is done by the Server
    class but is a built in as it is required and the argument structure is
    partly set.
    Functions:
        message(server,message,*args,**kwargs): send a message on the server. The
            message is passed as the first arguments. The rest of the arguments are
            as defined in command_args but will be optional. If no other arguments
            or options are provided the default must be to send the message so that
            all users on the server receive it.

Connect:
    This command just directly connects the user to the servers screen session
    and therefore isn't customisable. Adding extra arguments or options will just
    mislead the user.

Dump:
    The data dump is not customisable and defining any extra arguments or options
    will just mislead the user.

Set:
    This section documents the function used by the set built in command. All
    functions in this section recieve the same set of extra options as defined
    in command_args. The Server class does the setting and saving the data store
    it's self.
    Functions:
        checkvalue(server,key,*values,**kwargs): return the sanitised and
            converted value to store or raise a ServerError if the value isn't valid
            for the specified key. It is permissable to make a key read only by
            always raising a ServerError but explain why in the error message.
            The key will be already split and any integer elements (list indexes) will
            have been converted to an int. There is also a special key elemnt value of
            None which means the element will be appended to a list. New nodes will be
            created as needed. values being empty signifies a request to create nodes
            but not add new values. A special value of 'DELETE' can be returned to
            signify the user is requesting the key be deleted.
        postset(server,key,**kwargs) [OPTIONAL]: do any post processing needed when
            the the specified key is set. When this function is called the new value
            will already have been set and saved. This function could for example
            trigger the update logic if the level to use is changed or update other
            values to maintain consistency.

Backup:
    This section documents the backup built in command. This is defined as a
    built in so that all valid modules must provide it including a version with
    no arguments or options that does a deafault backup in a default location.
    The function is called directly and no processing is done by the Server.
    Functions:
        backup(server,*args,**kwargs): backup the server. The arguments are as
            defined in command_args but will all be optional. If no arguments or
            options are set do a default backup to a sensible location (Module 
            specific). Options and arguments may be used to modify what is backed
            up or where it is stored.
